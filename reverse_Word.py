# Examples of important string methods in python
#Python list methods are built-in functions that allow us to perform various operations on lists, 
# such as adding, removing, or modifying elements. 
# In this article, weâ€™ll explore all Python list methods with a simple example.


#-----append methods in python it adds the element at the end of the list
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a.append(5)
b = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
b.append("5")
#---copy methods in python it does the shallow copy of the elements in the list
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a.copy()
print(b)
